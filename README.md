**General Notes**

An `onlinecourse` app has already been provided in this repo upon which you will be adding a new assesement feature.

- If you want to develop the final project on Theia hosted by [IBM Developer Skills Network](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/), you will need to create the same project structure on Theia workspace and save it everytime you close the browser
- Or you could develop the final project locally by setting up your own Python runtime and IDE
- Hints for the final project are left on source code files
- You may choose any cloud platform for deployment (default is IBM Cloud Foundry)
- Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)
